    "# PROJECT: Comparison of classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repository: `challenge-classification`\n",
    "- Type of Challenge: `Learning`\n",
    "- Duration: `3 days`\n",
    "- Deadline: `dd/mm/yy H:i AM/PM`\n",
    "- Classification strategy :\n",
    "\t- Data gathering\n",
    "\t- Data preprocessing\n",
    "\t- Choose a model\n",
    "\t- Training\n",
    "\t- Evaluation of the model\n",
    "\t- Tuning of hyperparameters\n",
    "\t- Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Team challenge : `solo`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "You will learn to implement different classification algorithms in Python.\n",
    "At the end of the challenge, you will be able to:\n",
    "-  Choose the most appropriate algorithm, depending on the problem.\n",
    "-  Know the know-how, way to implement and logic behind most common classifiers.\n",
    "-  Manipulate different type of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mission\n",
    "You are a freelance developer and a Taiwan client approaches you with a huge problem. His previously hired developer messed things up with his project, a system to predict his employees' payments in order to adjust their salary accordingly. He is asking you to find the best possible way to predict this and build a product for him. You can find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). Process them, clean them, try different classifiers to see which fits this data better as he promised you a huge amount of money for it. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Must-have features\n",
    "- Use at least 5 different algorithms.\n",
    "- Have a clean dataset to work with.\n",
    "- Show the comparison of your models' evaluation metrics.\n",
    "- Your code should be formatted with [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)\n",
    "- Your code should be commented.\n",
    "- Your code should be cleaned of any commented unused code.\n",
    "- Each function or class has to contain a docstring formatted like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(number_one: int, number_two: int) -> int:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Function that will perform the add operation between two numbers (in params).\n",
    "\n",
    "    :param number_one: An int that will be added to the second parameter.\n",
    "    :param number_two: An int that will be added to the fist parameter.\n",
    "    :return: An int that is the result of the two params being added to each other.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    result = number_one + number_two\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nice-to-have features\n",
    "- Deploy your project and give the user the chance to choose the model each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.\n",
    "2. The deployment link, if applicable.\n",
    "3. Pimp up the README file:\n",
    "\t- What, Why, When, How, Who.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Create the repository.\n",
    "2. Study the request (What & Why ?)\n",
    "3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)\n",
    "4. Implement different classifiers\n",
    "5. Compare the results to find the more convenient algorithm\n",
